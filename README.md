# Hey, I’m Rasoul!

Cybersecurity geek with 10+ years tackling vulnerabilities, pentesting, and incident response. Certified CEH, OSCP+, OSWE. I’m here to build cool open-source security tools and share what I know.

## What I’m Good At
- Pentesting & vuln hunting (CEH, OWASP, OSCP+, OSWE)
- Threat modeling (MITRE ATT&CK, STRIDE)
- Incident response & forensic analysis (memory dumps, log diving)
- Cloud security (AWS, Azure hardening)
- Automation with Docker, Ansible, Splunk, and Python/Bash scripting
- Linux security (LPIC, kernel tweaking)
- Network security (Wireshark, Nmap mastery)
- Secure code review (PHP, Python, JavaScript)

## Big Wins
- Led 100+ pentests and built a cyber team from scratch.
- Cooked up security strategies with MITRE ATT&CK at CyberGuard Solutions.
- Co-founded a web exploit database for ethical hackers.
- Designed a custom vuln scanner that caught 50+ zero-days in the wild.
- Trained 50+ junior hackers to crush their first pentests.
- Discovered and responsibly disclosed 5 zero-day vulnerabilities in widely-used software.
- Designed a custom Splunk dashboard for real-time threat hunting, adopted company-wide.

## What I’m Into
- Building open-source vuln scanners and exploit tools (check my repos!).
- Exploring cloud security (AWS, Kubernetes, serverless hacks).
- Mentoring aspiring ethical hackers through workshops and 1:1 guidance.
- Diving into AI-driven threat detection and adversarial machine learning.
- Experimenting with zero-trust architecture in homelab setups.
- Reverse engineering malware for fun and learning.
- Helping newbies break into ethical hacking
