# Hey, Iâ€™m Rasoul! ðŸ‘‹

Cybersecurity enthusiast with 10+ years tackling vulnerabilities, pentesting, and incident response. Certified **CEH**, **OSCP+**, and **OSWE**. Currently, Iâ€™m focused on cloud security and automation in pentesting. Iâ€™m here to build impactful open-source security tools and share my knowledge.

## What Iâ€™m Good At ðŸ”’
- Pentesting & vulnerability hunting (CEH, OWASP, OSCP+, OSWE)  
- Threat modeling (MITRE ATT&CK, STRIDE)  
- Incident response & forensic analysis (memory dumps, log diving)  
- Cloud security (AWS, Azure hardening)  
- Automation with **Docker**, **Ansible**, **Splunk**, and **Python/Bash** scripting  
- Linux security (LPIC, kernel tweaking)  
- Network security (Wireshark, Nmap mastery)  
- Secure code review (PHP, Python, JavaScript)  

## Big Wins ðŸš€
- Led 100+ pentests, uncovering critical vulnerabilities that saved clients millions.  
- Built a cyber team from scratch and crafted security strategies with MITRE ATT&CK at CyberGuard Solutions.  
- Co-founded a web exploit database for ethical hackers, now used by 1,000+ pros.  
- Designed a custom vuln scanner that caught 50+ zero-days in the wild.  
- Trained 50+ junior hackers to ace their first pentests and land dream jobs.  
- Discovered and responsibly disclosed 5 zero-day vulnerabilities in popular software.  
- Built a Splunk dashboard for real-time threat hunting, adopted company-wide.  

## What Iâ€™m Into ðŸ’¡
- Building open-source vuln scanners and exploit tools (check my repos!).  
- Exploring cloud security (AWS, Kubernetes, serverless hacks).  
- Mentoring aspiring ethical hackers through workshops and 1:1 guidance.  
- Diving into AI-driven threat detection and adversarial machine learning.  
- Experimenting with zero-trust architecture in homelab setups.  
- Reverse engineering malware for fun and learning.  
- Helping newbies break into ethical hacking.
